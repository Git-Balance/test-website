            <p>I bought a bunch of <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/home/">Half Life Games</a> in a bundle a while ago. I decided to start playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force">Opposing Force</a>, when I came across something that relates to what we are learning.</p>

            <p>There is a tram in Opposing Force that you have to ride to advance in the game. It is a great example of how to use metal.</p>

                    <h3>Ductile</h3>
                    <p>Metal can be made into wires. Wires are bendable, but are capable of carrying a lot of weight. This makes them great for carrying a tram, since wires are able to bend in ways that materials like wood are simply incapable of.</p>

                    <h3>Malleable</h3>
                    <p>Metal can be bent or hammered into a specific shape without breaking. This lets people create strong parts relatively easily, like the walls and floor of the tram.</p>

                    <h3>Conducts Electricity</h3>
                    <p>Metal travels through electricity easily. This allows signals like <i>turn left</i>, <i>play message 3</i>, or <b>EMERGENCY BREAK</b> to be sent easily and quickly through electricity.</p>
